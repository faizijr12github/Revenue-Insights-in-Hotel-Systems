# AtliQ Hospitality Revenue Analysis Dashboard
## Project Overview

This project focuses on developing an interactive and insightful Revenue Analysis Dashboard for AtliQ Grands, a leading name in the luxury and business hotel segment. The dashboard empowers the revenue management team to identify key business challenges, uncover performance trends, and make data-driven decisions to regain market share and profitability.

## Project Statement

AtliQ Grands has been experiencing a decline in market share and overall revenue within the luxury/business hotels category. The purpose of this project is to analyze the key performance indicators (KPIs), diagnose the causes behind the decline, and propose actionable strategies for revenue recovery and sustainable growth.

## Core Metrics Analyzed

The analysis centers around critical hotel performance indicators, including:

- RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room): Measures how much revenue a hotel earns for each room that is available — whether it’s occupied or not.

- Occupancy (%): Represents the percentage of available rooms that are actually sold.

- ADR (Average Daily Rate): Calculates the average rate paid for rooms sold.

- DSRN (Daily Sellable Room Nights): Average number of rooms available for sale per day.

- DBRN (Daily Booked Room Nights): Tracks the number of rooms booked each day, including cancellations and no-shows.

- Cancellations: Highlights the percentage of canceled bookings, which may lead to partial refunds.

- No Show: Represents guests who neither canceled nor arrived, impacting realized revenue.

- DURN (Daily Utilized Room Nights): Reflects the number of rooms actually used by guests each day.


## Key Insights


- Occupancy % is 57.9 which is less
- Average Rating is 3.62 which means low customer satisfaction
- Occupancy % is higher on weekends than on weekdays
- ADR remained nearly identical, indicating missed revenue opportunities
- The RevPAR difference was minimal, meaning weekends were sold out at weekday prices
- More bookings come from platforms like Logtrip. They charge commission, so the hotel earns less profit
- Direct bookings (through website or in person) give full profit (100%), but make less revenue than booking platforms


## Business Recommendations
- Investigate internal failures and prioritize service quality improvement to restore performance
- Implement data-driven pricing strategies to differentiate weekday and weekend rates based on occupancy and demand patterns
- Reduce dependency on third-party platforms by strengthening direct online and offline booking channels
- Give discounts or free perks (like breakfast or late checkout) to guests who book directly


## Tools and Technologies

- Power BI – for interactive data visualization and dashboard design

- DAX and Power Query – for metric calculation and data transformation

- SQL – for data extraction and cleaning

- Excel – for exploratory analysis and data validation
